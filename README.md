# Embedded Machine Learning Scripts and Guides

This is a collection of scripts and guides by the <a href="https://embedded-machine-learning.github.io/webpage/">Christian Doppler Laboratory for Embedded Machine Learning</a>

We collect scripts and guides that help us in our everyday work to setup software and frameworks. This repository is also the source of an EML Toolbox that aims to easyily implement machine learning toolchains.
